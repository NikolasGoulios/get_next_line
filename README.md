Description

The Get Next Line project implements a function that reads and returns the next line from a given file or input stream. The function handles:

	•	Multiple lines of varying lengths.
	•	Different types of line endings (e.g., \n, \r\n).
	•	Large files efficiently by reading data in chunks.

This project is designed for educational purposes, helping to deepen understanding of file handling, buffers, and memory management in C.
